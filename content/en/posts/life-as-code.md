# Life as Code

This repository is a structured model for managing all aspects of life "as code"—applying modern development and infrastructure practices to personal, professional, and civic domains. It provides a unified system for automation, documentation, task management, and strategic review.

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Boost productivity** through digital workflows and streamlined task management.
2. **Enhance health and wellbeing** with tracking, planning, and automation.
3. **Optimise digital service spend** via consolidation, self-hosting, and audits.
4. **Learn modern coding and deployment techniques** (Git, scripts, IaC, static sites).
5. **Enable reuse** in consultancy, advocacy, and education.
