# Gwefan Cribarth Roadmap

This backlog outlines proposed improvements across content, design, accessibility,
performance, and operations. It is a living document and can be reordered or
trimmed as priorities change.

## Now (0-4 weeks)
- Define bilingual content targets (what must exist in both Welsh and English).
- Create Welsh translations for any English-only pages and vice versa.
- Add a consistent homepage introduction for both languages.
- Review the navigation structure for both languages and align page titles.
- Check internal links for language-aware routing and update where needed.
- Add a short site description and social preview text per language.

## Next (1-3 months)
- Create a content style guide for tone, terminology, and formatting in both languages.
- Standardize post front matter fields and ensure summaries are present.
- Add a Projects index layout that highlights featured items per language.
- Improve 404 and error page copy for both languages.
- Add basic privacy notice and contact details if required.
- Audit existing content for clarity, Welsh grammar, and consistency.

## Later (3-6 months)
- Add site-wide search (client-side) with bilingual indexing.
- Introduce a light-weight newsletter or updates section if needed.
- Add a media library or page bundles for project images.
- Create a dedicated About page in both languages.
- Add tags and categories pages with bilingual labels.

## Design and UX
- Review typography and spacing for readability in both languages.
- Add consistent hero sections or banners for key pages.
- Improve contrast and legibility across light and dark elements.
- Ensure footer, navigation, and language switcher are visually balanced.
- Add subtle visual motifs that reflect the Cribarth identity.

## Accessibility
- Audit headings order and page landmarks for screen readers.
- Ensure alt text exists for all images in both languages.
- Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA.
- Add focus styles and test keyboard navigation.

## Performance
- Compress images and use responsive sizes.
- Enable Hugo image processing where appropriate.
- Reduce unused CSS/JS and audit theme assets.
- Consider minified builds for production.

## SEO and Metadata
- Add per-language metadata (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter cards).
- Add canonical and alternate language links where needed.
- Generate sitemaps for both languages and confirm indexing.
- Add structured data for posts and projects.

## Analytics and Monitoring
- Decide on privacy-respecting analytics (or none) and document the choice.
- Add uptime and error monitoring if required.

## Operations
- Document release and publishing steps for bilingual updates.
- Add a pre-publish checklist (links, build, translations).
- Add content review cadence and ownership.
